# Introduction

This notebook documents the code used to translate the Global Coral Microbiome Project's collated metadata (provided by Jesse Zaneveld) into a format that GEOME can ingest. We are hoping to share the GCMP metadata on GEOME and for this to be a use-case to help improve GEOME's ability to store microbiome metadata.

The metadata provided by Jesse are in `GCMP_EMP_map_r29.txt`. The template to which we want to write the data is in `Global Coral Microbiome Project.xlsx`

# Setup

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

```

# Importing the data

```{r}

df <- read_tsv(file = "GCMP_EMP_map_r29.txt", na = "Missing: Not collected", 
              col_types = cols_only(
                date = col_date(format = "mdy"),
                pcrtubeno = "c"
                
              )) 
events <- df %>% select(collection_id,
                        reef_name)
```
